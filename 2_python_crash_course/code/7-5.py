# Movie Tickets: A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket.


prompt = "Enter age: "
prompt += "\n(Enter 'quit' when you are finished.) "

price = 0
while True:
    age = input(prompt)
    
    if age == 'quit':
        print(price) 
        break
    else:
        age = int(age)    
        
        if age < 3:
            continue
        if age > 3 and age < 12:
            price += 10
        if age >= 12:
            price +- 15
