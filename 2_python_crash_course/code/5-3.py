# Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

alien_color = 'green'

# Write an if statement to test whether the alienâ€™s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You win 5 points")
