# More Conditional Tests: You donâ€™t have to limit the number of tests you create to 10. If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests and add them to conditional_tests.py. Have at least one True and one False result for each of the following:

# Tests using the and keyword and the or keyword
# Test whether an item is in a list
# Test whether an item is not in a list


# Tests for equality and inequality with strings
# Tests using the lower() method
name = "Maria"
print("\nThe first letter of name != 'a'? I predict True.")
print(name[0].lower() != 'a')

# Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to
number = 10
print("Is the number >= 6, < 100, != 8 and even? I predict True")
print(number >= 6 and number < 100 and number != 8 and (number % 2 == 0))

# Tests using the and keyword and the or keyword
